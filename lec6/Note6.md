### BPP vs Probabilistic Method
Consider a language $L\in BPP$ with a randomized algorithm A, we can raise the probability of success by repeating A t times, the error probability can be $e^{-ct}$.
If we apply probabilistic method here:
    if a BPP algorithm A with error probability $e^{-n^2}$, suppose the number of different random strings is m, we can prove BPP=P in the following way, what is wrong?
